# kopia-server

Lightweight, supervised Docker image for the [Kopia](https://github.com/kopia/kopia) backup server.

This image is very different from the official Kopia server image. It is designed with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. It is based on the [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) distribution and uses s6 supervisor. 

For that reason, this is at least temporarily a separate project.
